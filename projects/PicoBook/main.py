    Initializes the OLED display and attempts to connect to a Wi-Fi network.

    1. Clears the OLED display and shows an "Initializing..." message.
    2. Activates the Wi-Fi interface and connects to the network using credentials
       stored in the `secrets` module.
    3. Attempts to connect to the Wi-Fi network up to 20 times, with a 0.5-second
       delay between attempts.
    4. If the connection is successful:
       - Displays "Wi-Fi Connected!" on the OLED.
       - Shows the IP address and network SSID on the OLED.
    5. If the connection fails after 20 attempts:
