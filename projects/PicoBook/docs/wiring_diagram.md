## üß† Pin Mapping

| Component       | Function      | Pico GPIO | Notes                  |
|----------------|---------------|-----------|------------------------|
| OLED Display   | SDA (I2C)     | GPIO 2    | I2C1 SDA               |
| OLED Display   | SCL (I2C)     | GPIO 3    | I2C1 SCL               |
| OLED Display   | VCC           | 3.3V      | Use regulated output   |
| OLED Display   | GND           | GND       |                        |
| Button         | Signal        | GPIO 16   | Internal pull-up used  |
| Button         | GND           | GND       | One side to ground     |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Wiring Notes

- OLED uses **I2C1**, which is set in code using GPIO 2 (SDA) and GPIO 3 (SCL).
- Button is connected to **GPIO 16** and uses **internal pull-up**.
- Be sure to debounce the button in code or via capacitor if needed.
- Power is provided via USB or buck converter regulated to 3.3V.

## üîß Optional Additions

- Add 0.1¬µF decoupling capacitor across OLED VCC/GND
- Add reset button tied to the Pico's `RUN` pin
- For production: use low-profile headerless solder joints
